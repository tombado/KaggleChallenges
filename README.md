# KaggleChallenges
Here I will upload my notebooks for different Kaggle challenges!


Toxic Comment Classification - Score: 0.97464 
In this challenge I have used a multilayered neural network with an GloVe embedding layer, LSTM layer and GRU layer. In addition to the embedding layer, I have implemented two features. One feature represent the amount of exlamation marks used in the sentence and the other feature represent the amount of CAPS used in the sentence. These features are scaled between 0 and 1.
